**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures**

The goal of first aid for intergenerational trauma is to provide immediate support and stabilization while awaiting professional help. Focus on creating a safe and supportive environment.

**Step 1: Assess the Situation**

*   **Ensure safety:**  Is the individual safe from immediate harm?  Remove any potential hazards.
*   **Approach calmly and respectfully:** Introduce yourself and let the individual know you are there to help.
*   **Listen actively:** Pay attention to what the individual is saying, both verbally and nonverbally.  Avoid interrupting or judging.

**Step 2: Provide Immediate Support**

*   **Grounding techniques:** If the individual is experiencing dissociation or feeling overwhelmed, guide them through grounding exercises:
    *   **5-4-3-2-1 method:** Ask them to name 5 things they can see, 4 things they can touch, 3 things they can hear, 2 things they can smell, and 1 thing they can taste.
