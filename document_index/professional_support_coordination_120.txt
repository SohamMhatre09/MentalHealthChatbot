        *   Increased absenteeism or lateness.
        *   Withdrawal from social activities and isolation.
        *   Procrastination and difficulty completing tasks.
        *   Increased use of alcohol, drugs, or other substances as a coping mechanism.
        *   Increased emotional outbursts or conflicts with others.

**2. When to Seek Emergency Medical Help:**

The following situations warrant immediate emergency medical or mental health intervention:

*   **Suicidal ideation:** Thoughts of harming oneself.
