**1. Definition and Symptoms**

LGBTQ+ individuals experience mental health conditions at a higher rate than their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. This disparity is primarily attributed to factors such as:

*   **Discrimination and Stigma:** Prejudice, harassment, and social rejection can lead to chronic stress and mental health issues.
*   **Internalized Stigma:** Internalizing negative societal attitudes can lead to feelings of shame, self-doubt, and low self-esteem.
*   **Minority Stress:** The cumulative effect of experiencing discrimination and prejudice over time.
*   **Lack of Access to Affirming Care:** Difficulty finding healthcare providers who understand and are sensitive to LGBTQ+ needs.
