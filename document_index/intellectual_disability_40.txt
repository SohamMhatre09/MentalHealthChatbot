## First Aid Guide: Intellectual Disability

**Disclaimer:** This guide provides general first aid information for individuals with intellectual disability. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Always seek immediate medical attention when necessary. This guide focuses on providing support during emergencies and does not address the underlying causes or long-term management of intellectual disability.

**1. Definition and Symptoms**

*   **Definition:** Intellectual disability (ID) is a condition characterized by significant limitations in both intellectual functioning (reasoning, learning, problem-solving) and adaptive behavior, which covers a range of everyday social and practical skills. These limitations begin during the developmental period (before age 18).

*   **Diagnosis:** ID is diagnosed through standardized assessments of intellectual functioning (typically an IQ score of 70-75 or below) and adaptive behavior (significant limitations in areas like communication, self-care, social skills, home living, community use, self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure, and work). Severity is often classified as mild, moderate, severe, or profound.

*   **Symptoms:** Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the intellectual disability, but common characteristics include:
    *   **Cognitive:**
        *   Slower learning pace
        *   Difficulty understanding complex concepts
        *   Trouble with problem-solving and reasoning
        *   Memory difficulties
        *   Attention deficits
    *   **Adaptive Behavior:**
        *   Difficulties with communication (verbal and nonverbal)
        *   Challenges with self-care (dressing, feeding, hygiene)
        *   Social skill deficits (interacting with others, understanding social cues)
        *   Difficulties with daily living skills (managing money, using public transportation)
        *   Challenges with safety awareness

**Important Note:** People with intellectual disabilities can experience a wide range of emotions, have unique personalities, and should be treated with respect and dignity.

**2. When to Seek Emergency Medical Help**

*   **Sudden Changes in Behavior:** Abrupt changes in behavior, such as increased aggression, withdrawal, or confusion, especially if uncharacteristic.
*   **Seizures:** Any seizure activity, especially if prolonged or if the individual has never had a seizure before.
*   **Injuries:** Falls, cuts, burns, or any other physical injuries that require medical attention.
*   **Difficulty Breathing:** Signs of respiratory distress, such as gasping, wheezing, or blue discoloration of the skin.
*   **Choking:** Inability to breathe, cough, or speak due to an obstruction in the airway.
*   **Unresponsiveness:** Lack of response to stimuli or loss of consciousness.
*   **Medical Condition Exacerbation:** Worsening of any pre-existing medical condition (e.g., heart problems, diabetes, epilepsy).
*   **Suspected Overdose or Poisoning:** If there's suspicion of ingestion of a harmful substance.
*   **Significant Changes in Health Status:** Any significant and unexplained changes in health, such as sudden weight loss, fever, vomiting, or diarrhea.
*   **Signs of Abuse or Neglect:** Physical injuries, unexplained bruises, malnourishment, or any indications of abuse or neglect.

**Call Emergency Services (e.g., 911) Immediately in the Following Situations:**

*   The individual is unresponsive or has stopped breathing.
*   There's severe bleeding that cannot be controlled.
*   The individual is choking and cannot breathe.
*   There's suspicion of a severe head injury.
*   There's a seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes or repeated seizures without regaining consciousness.

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures**

These procedures are adapted for individuals with intellectual disability. Emphasize clear, simple communication and a calm, reassuring approach.

*   **General Principles:**
    *   **Stay Calm:** Your composure will help the individual remain calm.
    *   **Introduce Yourself:** State your name and that you are there to help.
    *   **Simple Language:** Use short, clear sentences and avoid jargon.
    *   **One Step at a Time:** Give instructions one step at a time.
    *   **Visual Aids:** Use pictures or gestures to communicate if verbal communication is difficult.
    *   **Respect Personal Space:** Avoid sudden movements and respect their personal space.
    *   **Involve Known Support Person (If Available):** If a caregiver, family member, or support worker is present, involve them in the situation.
    *   **Reassurance:** Continuously reassure the individual that they are safe and that you are there to help.
    *   **Sensory Considerations:** Be aware of potential sensory sensitivities (e.g., loud noises, bright lights, physical touch).
*   **Specific Scenarios:**

    *   **Seizure:**
        1.  **Protect:** Clear the area around the person to prevent injury.
        2.  **Support:** Gently guide them to the floor if they are standing.
        3.  **Cushion:** Place something soft under their head.
        4.  **Observe:** Note the time the seizure started and its characteristics.
        5.  **Do Not Restrain:** Do not try to restrain the person's movements.
        6.  **Do Not Put Anything in Their Mouth:** This is a myth and can cause injury.
        7.  **After the Seizure:** Once the seizure stops, gently turn the person onto their side (recovery position). Stay with them and reassure them until they are fully alert. Check for injuries.
        8.  **Call Emergency Services:** If the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, is the person's first seizure, or if they have difficulty breathing after the seizure.

    *   **Choking:**
        1.  **Ask:** "Are you choking? Can you speak?"
        2.  **Encourage Coughing:** If the person can cough forcefully, encourage them to continue coughing.
        3.  **Heimlich Maneuver (Abdominal Thrusts):** If the person cannot cough, speak, or breathe:
            *   Stand behind the person and wrap your arms around their waist.
            *   Make a fist with one hand and place the thumb side against the middle of their abdomen, slightly above the navel and well below the breastbone.
            *   Grasp your fist with your other hand.
            *   Give quick, upward thrusts into the abdomen.
            *   Repeat until the object is dislodged or the person becomes unconscious.
        4.  **Unconscious Choking:** If the person becomes unconscious, lower them carefully to the ground and begin CPR. Call for emergency medical help immediately.

    *   **Wound Care (Cuts and Scrapes):**
        1.  **Wash Hands:** Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.
        2.  **Control Bleeding:** Apply direct pressure to the wound with a clean cloth.
        3.  **Clean the Wound:** Gently clean the wound with mild soap and water. Avoid using harsh chemicals or antiseptics.
        4.  **Apply Antibiotic Ointment:** Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment.
        5.  **Cover the Wound:** Cover the wound with a sterile bandage.

    *   **Burns:**
        1.  **Cool the Burn:** Immediately cool the burn with cool (not cold) running water for 10-20 minutes.
        2.  **Remove Clothing:** Carefully remove any clothing or jewelry from around the burn area (unless it is stuck to the skin).
        3.  **Cover the Burn:** Cover the burn loosely with a sterile bandage or clean cloth.
        4.  **Do Not Apply:** Do not apply butter, creams, or ointments to the burn.
        5.  **Seek Medical Attention:** Seek medical attention for burns that are larger than 3 inches in diameter, are located on the face, hands, feet, genitals, or major joints, or if the person has any signs of shock.
