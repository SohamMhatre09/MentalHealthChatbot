**Safety First:** Your safety and the safety of others is paramount. If you feel threatened, remove yourself from the situation and call for professional help.

**3.1 Initial Assessment & Preparation:**

*   **Assess the situation:** Observe the person's behavior, emotional state, and the surrounding environment.
*   **Ensure safety:** Remove any potential hazards or weapons from the immediate area.
*   **Maintain calm:** Speak in a calm, quiet, and respectful tone. Avoid yelling or raising your voice.

*   **Identify yourself:** Introduce yourself and your role (e.g., "Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I'm here to help.").

**3.2 Active Listening and Empathy:**

*   **Listen attentively:** Give the person your undivided attention. Make eye contact (if appropriate) and show that you are listening.
*   **Use open-ended questions:** Encourage the person to express their feelings and concerns (e.g., "Can you tell me what's happening?" "How are you feeling right now?").
*   **Reflect and paraphrase:** Show that you understand what the person is saying by reflecting their statements back to them (e.g., "So, it sounds like you're feeling really frustrated because...").
*   **Validate their feelings:** Acknowledge and validate their emotions, even if you don't agree with their behavior (e.g., "I understand that you're feeling angry right now.").
*   **Avoid judgmental statements:** Refrain from criticizing, lecturing, or minimizing their feelings. Avoid using phrases like "You shouldn't feel that way" or "Just calm down."

**3.3 Establishing Rapport and Building Trust:**

*   **Show empathy and compassion:** Demonstrate that you care about their well-being.

**3.5 Setting Limits (If Necessary):**

*   **Use clear and concise language:** Clearly state the limits and consequences of unacceptable behavior (e.g., "It's okay to be angry, but it's not okay to yell at me. If you continue to yell, I will need to take a step back.").
*   **Be consistent:** Enforce the limits consistently.
*   **Avoid power struggles:** Don't get into an argument with the person.
