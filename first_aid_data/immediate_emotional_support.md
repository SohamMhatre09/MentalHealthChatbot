*   **Overdose or suspected overdose:** Taking a dangerous amount of medication or drugs.

**Call emergency services (e.g., 911, your local emergency number) immediately if any of these conditions are present.**

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures**

These steps are designed to provide immediate support and stabilize the situation.

*   **Step 1: Ensure Safety:**  Prioritize the safety of both the individual in distress and yourself. Remove any immediate dangers from the environment (e.g., sharp objects, substances). If there's a risk of violence, call for professional assistance (police).
*   **Step 2: Approach Calmly and Non-Judgmentally:** Approach the individual in a calm, reassuring manner. Introduce yourself clearly and speak in a soft, even tone. Avoid making sudden movements or raising your voice.
*   **Step 3: Listen Actively:** Let the person talk without interruption (unless they are expressing harmful ideations). Listen attentively, demonstrating empathy and understanding.  Use open-ended questions like, "Can you tell me what's happening?" or "How are you feeling right now?".
*   **Step 4: Validate Their Feelings:** Acknowledge and validate their emotions. Avoid dismissing or minimizing their experience. Examples: "It sounds like you're going through something really difficult," or "I can see that you're feeling overwhelmed."
*   **Step 5: Offer Practical Support:** Ask how you can help. This might involve getting them a glass of water, helping them find a quiet space, contacting a trusted friend or family member, or simply offering a comforting presence.
*   **Step 6: Help with Grounding Techniques:** If the individual is experiencing dissociation or anxiety, encourage grounding techniques to bring them back to the present moment. Examples:
    *   **5-4-3-2-1 Exercise:**  Ask them to identify 5 things they can see, 4 things they can touch, 3 things they can hear, 2 things they can smell, and 1 thing they can taste.
    *   **Deep Breathing:** Guide them to take slow, deep breaths, inhaling through the nose and exhaling slowly through the mouth.  Focus on the feeling of the breath.
    *   **Sensory Input:** Offer a calming object like a soft blanket, a stress ball, or a comforting scent (e.g., lavender).
*   **Step 7: Avoid Giving Unsolicited Advice:** Unless the individual specifically asks for advice, focus on providing support and listening. Avoid making statements like "You should…" or "You just need to…".
*   **Step 8: Encourage Seeking Professional Help:**  Normalize seeking professional help. Explain that talking to a therapist or counselor can be beneficial.  Offer to help them find resources or make an appointment.
*   **Step 9: Monitor and Follow Up:**  After the initial crisis has subsided, continue to monitor the individual and offer ongoing support. Encourage them to follow through with any professional help they may seek.
*   **Step 10: Document:** Keep a written record of the event and your actions for future reference and potential professional reporting.

**4. Home Remedies and Self-Care Tips**
