**Bipolar Episode Management: A First Aid Guide**

**1. Definition and Symptoms:**

*   **Definition:** Bipolar disorder (formerly known as manic-depressive illness) is a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, concentration, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. These shifts manifest as episodes of mania or hypomania (elevated mood) and episodes of depression (low mood).
*   **Mania:** An abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least one week.  Includes at least three of the following (or four if the mood is only irritable):
    *   Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity
    *   Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep)
    *   More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking
    *   Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing
    *   Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli)
    *   Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed activity)
    *   Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments)
    *   Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) may be present in severe mania.
*   **Hypomania:** Similar to mania but less severe.  Lasts at least four consecutive days.  Not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning, or to require hospitalization, and there are no psychotic features.
*   **Depression:** Characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, fatigue, and other symptoms, lasting at least two weeks. Includes at least five of the following:
    *   Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day
    *   Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day
    *   Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day
    *   Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day
    *   Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day
    *   Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day
    *   Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day
    *   Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day
    *   Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.
*   **Mixed Features:**  Symptoms of both mania and depression occurring at the same time.
*   **Rapid Cycling:**  Having four or more mood episodes within a 12-month period.

**2. When to Seek Emergency Medical Help:**

*   **Suicidal Ideation or Attempts:** Any thoughts of harming oneself or others, or any suicide attempt.
*   **Psychotic Symptoms:** Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there) or delusions (false, fixed beliefs).
*   **Severe Mania:**  Marked impairment in functioning, loss of touch with reality, inability to care for oneself, extreme agitation, dangerous or reckless behavior.
*   **Medical Emergency due to Bipolar Episode:**  Dehydration, exhaustion, neglect of medical conditions.
*   **Sudden Change in Mental Status:**  Abrupt changes in mood, behavior, or thought processes.
*   **Substance Abuse:** Intoxication or withdrawal symptoms that exacerbate a bipolar episode.
*   **Any concerns about the safety of the individual or others.**

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures:**

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Prioritize Safety:** Ensure the safety of the individual and those around them. Remove potentially dangerous objects (medications, weapons, sharp objects).
*   **Stay Calm:**  Maintain a calm and reassuring demeanor. Avoid arguing or getting into power struggles.
*   **Speak Simply and Clearly:** Use simple, direct language.  Avoid complex instructions or abstract concepts.
*   **Respect Personal Space:** Be mindful of personal space. Avoid crowding or touching the individual without permission.
*   **Listen Empathetically:**  Actively listen to the individual's concerns without judgment. Validate their feelings.
*   **Do Not Argue or Try to Reason with Delusions or Hallucinations:**  Acknowledge their experience without agreeing with the content.  For example, "I understand that you are seeing something, but I don't see it."

**First Aid Steps:**

1.  **Assess the Situation:**
    *   Identify the signs and symptoms of the episode (mania, hypomania, depression, mixed).
    *   Determine the severity of the episode.
    *   Assess for immediate safety concerns (suicidal thoughts, aggression, psychosis).
    *   Check for any underlying medical conditions or substance use.

2.  **Ensure Safety:**
    *   Remove any potential hazards from the environment.
    *   If the person is actively suicidal or homicidal, **call 911 (or your local emergency number) immediately.** Do not leave the person alone until help arrives.
    *   If the person is agitated or aggressive, maintain a safe distance and avoid confrontation.  Call for assistance if needed.

3.  **Provide a Calm and Supportive Environment:**
    *   Find a quiet, private space if possible.
    *   Speak in a calm, reassuring tone.
    *   Offer simple comfort measures: a blanket, a drink of water, a quiet activity.

4.  **Encourage Medication Adherence:**
    *   If the person is prescribed medication, encourage them to take it as directed.
    *   If they are refusing medication, do not force them. Contact their mental health provider for guidance.

5.  **Support Self-Soothing Techniques:**
    *   Encourage the person to engage in previously successful coping mechanisms: deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, mindfulness exercises, listening to music.

6.  **For Mania/Hypomania:**
    *   Help the person focus on simple, structured tasks.
    *   Limit stimulation (noise, bright lights, social interaction).
    *   Encourage rest and sleep.
    *   Help the person avoid impulsive decisions (spending money, risky behaviors).
    *   Remind them to drink water, and eat healthy foods, even if they do not feel hungry or thirsty.
7.  **For Depression:**
    *   Encourage gentle activity (a short walk, stretching).
    *   Help the person maintain a regular sleep schedule.
    *   Offer healthy food and encourage them to eat.
    *   Remind them that the feelings are temporary and will pass.
    *   Be patient and understanding.
8.  **Contact Their Mental Health Provider:**
    *   Inform the person's psychiatrist, therapist, or other healthcare professional about the episode.
    *   Seek guidance on medication adjustments or other treatment strategies.
    *   Provide the provider with accurate and detailed information about the symptoms and behaviors.

9.  **After the Episode:**
    *   Encourage the person to attend therapy and support groups.
    *   Help them identify triggers for mood episodes.
    *   Develop a relapse prevention plan.
    *   Offer ongoing support and encouragement.
