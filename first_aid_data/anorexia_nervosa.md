    *   Muscle weakness.
    *   Lanugo (soft, downy hair all over the body).
    *   Edema (swelling).
    *   Bradycardia (slow heart rate).
    *   Hypotension (low blood pressure).

**2. When to Seek Emergency Medical Help**

Anorexia Nervosa can lead to life-threatening complications. Seek immediate emergency medical attention if any of the following are present:

*   **Severe Dehydration:** Symptoms include decreased urination, dark urine, extreme thirst, dizziness, and confusion.
*   **Electrolyte Imbalances:** May cause seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac arrest. Signs may include muscle weakness, cramping, irregular heartbeat, and confusion.
*   **Bradycardia (significantly low heart rate):** Below 40 beats per minute.
*   **Hypotension (significantly low blood pressure):** Systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg.
*   **Cardiac Arrhythmias:** Palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting.
*   **Severe Chest Pain**
*   **Syncope (fainting) or Loss of Consciousness.**
*   **Severe Weakness or Paralysis.**
*   **Suicidal Thoughts or Attempts:** Immediately call emergency services (911 in the US) or a suicide prevention hotline.
*   **Confusion, Altered Mental Status, or Seizures.**
*   **Hypothermia (dangerously low body temperature):** Especially if the person is unable to warm themselves.
*   **Uncontrolled Vomiting or Diarrhea:** Leading to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
*   **Hematemesis:** Vomiting blood.
*   **Melena:** Black, tarry stools (indicating gastrointestinal bleeding).
*   **Rhabdomyolysis:** Muscle breakdown leading to kidney failure. Symptoms include muscle pain, weakness, and dark urine.
*   **Signs of refeeding syndrome:** Rapid and dangerous metabolic shifts that can occur when someone who is severely malnourished begins to eat again. Symptoms include confusion, weakness, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmia.
*   **Known or Suspected Overdose of Laxatives, Diuretics, or Diet Pills:**

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures**

**Important:**  First aid for anorexia nervosa focuses on addressing immediate life-threatening complications.  It is crucial to get the individual to a qualified medical professional as soon as possible for comprehensive assessment and treatment.

*   **Assess the Situation:**
    *   **Safety:** Ensure the safety of the environment for yourself and the person.
    *   **Responsiveness:** Check if the person is conscious and responsive.
    *   **Breathing:** Check if the person is breathing normally.
    *   **Circulation:** Check for a pulse.
*   **If Unresponsive and Not Breathing:**
    *   Call emergency services (911 in the US).
    *   Begin CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) if you are trained. Follow the dispatcher's instructions.
*   **If Responsive but Showing Signs of Distress:**
    *   **Call Emergency Services:**  Explain the situation and the person's medical history (if known).
    *   **Monitor Vital Signs:** If possible, monitor heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature while waiting for medical help.
    *   **Provide a Calm and Supportive Environment:** Reduce anxiety and stress. Speak calmly and reassuringly.
    *   **Address Dehydration (If Conscious and Able to Swallow):** Offer small sips of water or an electrolyte solution (e.g., Pedialyte).  Do not force fluids if the person is resistant or nauseous.  Avoid sugary drinks.
    *   **Address Hypothermia (If Present):**  Wrap the person in blankets to conserve body heat. Avoid vigorous rubbing of extremities, which can worsen vasodilation.
    *   **Prevent Falls:** If the person is weak or dizzy, assist them to sit or lie down to prevent falls.
    *   **Do Not Encourage or Facilitate Purging Behaviors:** Do not assist with vomiting, restrict fluid intake further, or provide laxatives.

**4. Home Remedies and Self-Care Tips (To be used in conjunction with professional help, not as a replacement):**

*   **Engage in Therapy:**  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Family-Based Therapy (FBT), and other therapies are crucial for addressing the underlying psychological issues of anorexia nervosa.
*   **Nutritional Rehabilitation:** Work with a registered dietitian to develop a meal plan that meets the individual's nutritional needs and helps them gradually and safely regain weight.  This requires medical supervision to avoid refeeding syndrome.
*   **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Practices like meditation, deep breathing, and yoga can help reduce anxiety and improve body awareness.
*   **Healthy Coping Mechanisms:** Identify and practice healthy ways to cope with stress, anxiety, and negative emotions. This could include journaling, spending time in nature, or engaging in creative activities.
*   **Social Support:** Connect with supportive friends, family members, or support groups. Isolation can worsen the condition.
*   **Regular Gentle Exercise (Under Medical Supervision):** Once medically stable, gentle exercise can be incorporated into the treatment plan, but it must be carefully monitored and supervised to prevent overexertion and relapse.
*   **Avoid Triggers:** Identify and avoid situations, people, or media that trigger negative thoughts and behaviors related to food and body image.
*   **Journaling:** To track feelings, food intake, and exercise.
*   **Focus on Health, Not Weight:** Shift the focus from weight and appearance to overall health and well-being.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Refeeding Syndrome:**  Individuals with anorexia nervosa are at risk of developing refeeding syndrome when they begin to eat again. This is a dangerous condition that can lead to electrolyte imbalances, cardiac arrhythmias, and even death.  Nutritional rehabilitation must be done under close medical supervision in a hospital or specialized eating disorder treatment center.
*   **Co-occurring Conditions:** Anorexia nervosa often occurs with other mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and personality disorders. These conditions must be addressed as part of a comprehensive treatment plan.
*   **Family Involvement:**  Family involvement is often crucial for successful treatment, especially for adolescents.

**5. Prevention Measures:**

Preventing anorexia nervosa is challenging, but the following strategies can help:

*   **Promote Positive Body Image:** Encourage acceptance and appreciation of diverse body shapes and sizes.  Discourage dieting and weight shaming.
*   **Encourage Healthy Eating Habits:** Focus on balanced nutrition and mindful eating rather than restrictive diets.
*   **Promote Media Literacy:** Teach children and adolescents to critically evaluate media messages that promote unrealistic beauty standards.
*   **Early Intervention:**  Be aware of the early warning signs of eating disorders and seek professional help immediately if you are concerned about yourself or someone you know.
*   **Reduce Stigma:** Create a supportive and understanding environment where people feel comfortable talking about body image and mental health concerns.
*   **Parental Role Modeling:** Parents can model healthy eating habits, positive body image, and healthy coping mechanisms for their children.
*   **Address Teasing or Bullying:** Intervene promptly if you witness or hear about teasing or bullying related to weight or appearance.
*   **Educate About Eating Disorders:** Increase awareness of the dangers of eating disorders and the importance of seeking help.
*   **Promote Mental Health:** Encourage open communication about feelings and promote healthy coping mechanisms for stress and anxiety.

This guide provides a starting point for understanding and responding to anorexia nervosa.  Remember to prioritize professional medical help and support for individuals struggling with this complex and serious condition.
