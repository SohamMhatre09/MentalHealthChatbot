*   **Severe depression:** Characterized by prolonged sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest in activities, and significant changes in sleep, appetite, or energy levels.
*   **Sudden and significant decline in mental state:** Especially if accompanied by confusion or disorientation.

**In these cases, contact emergency services (e.g., 911 in the US), a crisis hotline, or take the individual to the nearest emergency room immediately.**

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures:**

These procedures aim to provide immediate support and temporary relief from the distress associated with low self-esteem.

*   **Step 1: Safety and Validation:**
    *   **Ensure Safety:** Prioritize the person's safety. If there are any concerns about self-harm, follow the instructions in Section 2.
    *   **Active Listening:** Listen empathetically to the person's concerns without judgment. Avoid dismissing their feelings or offering unsolicited advice.
    *   **Validation:** Acknowledge and validate their feelings. Use phrases like: "I understand you're feeling down," or "It sounds like you're going through a difficult time." Avoid saying things like "Just snap out of it" or "It's not that bad."

*   **Step 2: Challenge Negative Thoughts:**
    *   **Identify Negative Thoughts:** Help the person identify the specific negative thoughts that are contributing to their low self-esteem (e.g., "I'm a failure," "Nobody likes me").
    *   **Question the Evidence:** Gently challenge the validity of these thoughts. Ask questions like: "Is there any evidence to support that thought?" "What's the worst that could happen if that thought were true?" "Is there another way to look at the situation?"
    *   **Reframing:** Help the person reframe negative thoughts into more balanced and realistic ones. For example, "I made a mistake" can be reframed as "Everyone makes mistakes. I can learn from this."

*   **Step 3: Focus on Strengths and Accomplishments:**
    *   **Identify Strengths:** Encourage the person to identify their strengths and positive qualities. Help them remember past accomplishments, even small ones.
    *   **Remind of Achievements:** Remind the person of past successes and times they have overcome challenges.
    *   **Positive Reinforcement:** Offer specific and sincere praise for their efforts and accomplishments.

*   **Step 4: Promote Self-Care:**
    *   **Encourage Healthy Habits:** Gently encourage the person to engage in self-care activities, such as getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and exercising regularly.
    *   **Relaxation Techniques:** Suggest relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation.
    *   **Engage in Enjoyable Activities:** Encourage the person to engage in activities they find enjoyable and that bring them a sense of accomplishment.

*   **Step 5: Encourage Seeking Professional Help:**
    *   **Normalize Seeking Help:** Emphasize that seeking professional help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
    *   **Provide Resources:** Offer information about local mental health resources, such as therapists, counselors, and support groups.
    *   **Offer Support:** Offer to help the person find a therapist or counselor, or to accompany them to their first appointment.
