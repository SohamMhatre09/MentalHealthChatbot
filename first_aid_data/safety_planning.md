## First Aid Guide: Safety Planning in Situations of Abuse or Danger

**Disclaimer:** This guide provides general first aid information for safety planning in situations of abuse, violence, or immediate danger. It is *not* a substitute for professional help. If you are in immediate danger, call emergency services (911 in the US, 999 in the UK, 000 in Australia, or your local emergency number). If you are experiencing abuse, reaching out to a crisis hotline or trusted individual is crucial.

**1. Definition and Symptoms**

**Definition:** Safety planning is a proactive process of identifying potential dangers, assessing risks, and developing a personalized strategy to minimize harm and increase safety for individuals experiencing abuse, violence, or other potentially dangerous situations. It's not a single event but an ongoing process of evaluation and adjustment.

**Symptoms/Indicators Requiring a Safety Plan:** While not symptoms in the medical sense, indicators that a safety plan is needed include:

*   **Escalating Arguments/Conflict:** A noticeable increase in the frequency, intensity, or severity of arguments or disagreements.
*   **Threats/Intimidation:** Verbal or non-verbal threats of harm to the individual, their children, pets, or possessions. This includes stalking and harassment.
*   **Physical Abuse:** Any form of physical violence, including hitting, kicking, slapping, pushing, or restraining.
*   **Emotional Abuse:** Consistent belittling, insults, isolation, manipulation, and control tactics.
*   **Sexual Abuse:** Any unwanted sexual contact or coercion.
*   **Financial Abuse:** Controlling access to finances, preventing the individual from working, or exploiting their financial resources.
*   **Isolation:** Being prevented from seeing friends or family, or being monitored excessively.
*   **Increased Substance Abuse:** A noticeable increase in substance use by the abuser, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior.
*   **Suicidal/Homicidal Thoughts:** Expressing thoughts of self-harm or harming others.
*   **Feelings of Fear/Anxiety:** Persistent feelings of fear, anxiety, helplessness, or being constantly on edge.
*   **Controlling Behavior:** The other person trying to control where you go, who you see, or what you do.

**2. When to Seek Emergency Medical Help**

Seek immediate emergency medical help (call 911/999/000 or your local emergency number) if:

*   **Active Danger:** You are currently experiencing physical or sexual assault, or you believe you are in immediate danger of being seriously harmed.
*   **Serious Injury:** You or someone you are with has sustained a serious injury requiring immediate medical attention (e.g., broken bones, head trauma, severe bleeding, difficulty breathing).
*   **Suicidal/Homicidal Ideation:** You or someone you are with is expressing suicidal or homicidal thoughts and has a plan.
*   **Unconsciousness:** You or someone you are with is unconscious or unresponsive.
*   **Overdose:** You or someone you are with has overdosed on drugs or alcohol.
*   **Stalking and Physical Proximity:** You are being stalked and the perpetrator is in your immediate vicinity or has made a direct threat.

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures (Safety Planning)**

This involves creating a personalized safety plan. It is best to create this plan when you are calm and in a safe place.

*   **A. Identify Warning Signs/Triggers:**
    *   **Recognize Escalation:** Identify specific behaviors or situations that typically precede violent episodes.
    *   **Document:** Keep a detailed record (if safe to do so) of incidents, including dates, times, locations, and specific details of the abuse or violence. This documentation can be valuable for legal proceedings.
*   **B. Identify Safe Spaces:**
    *   **Within the Home:** Identify rooms or areas in your home where you feel safest (e.g., with multiple exits, a phone). Avoid areas with weapons or that can be easily blocked.
    *   **Outside the Home:** Identify safe locations to go to in case you need to leave (e.g., a friend's house, a shelter, a police station). Have multiple options.
*   **C. Develop an Escape Plan:**
    *   **Practice:** Mentally rehearse your escape plan, including different scenarios.
    *   **Emergency Bag:** Prepare a small bag with essential items (identification, money, medications, keys, phone charger, important documents, change of clothes) and keep it hidden in a safe and easily accessible location.
    *   **Code Words:** Establish a code word or phrase with trusted friends, family, or neighbors to signal that you need help.
    *   **Transportation:** Identify transportation options in case you need to leave quickly (e.g., a friend who can drive you, taxi, public transport).
*   **D. Communicate with Trusted Individuals:**
    *   **Confide in Someone:** Tell a trusted friend, family member, or coworker about the abuse and your safety plan.
    *   **Seek Support:**  Contact a domestic violence hotline or support organization for guidance and resources.
    *   **Develop a Support Network:** Identify people you can call on for help, support, and a safe place to stay.
*   **E. Legal Considerations:**
    *   **Restraining Order:** Consider obtaining a restraining order or protection order.
    *   **Custody Arrangements:** If children are involved, understand your legal rights and options regarding custody and visitation.
    *   **Documentation:** Collect any evidence of abuse or violence (e.g., photos, medical records, police reports) that may be relevant in legal proceedings.
*   **F. Technology Safety:**
    *   **Privacy:** Be aware that technology (e.g., phone, computer, social media) can be used to monitor you. Use safe browsing practices and protect your passwords.
    *   **Secret Email Account:** Consider setting up a secret email account that the abuser doesn't know about for communication related to your safety plan.
    *   **Location Services:** Be cautious about location services on your phone and consider turning them off when necessary.
*   **G. After Leaving:**
    *   **Change Routines:** Change your daily routines (e.g., routes to work, shopping habits) to minimize the risk of being found.
    *   **Security:** Enhance your home security (e.g., change locks, install security system).
    *   **Legal Updates:** Update legal documents (e.g., will, power of attorney) as necessary.

These tips are supplementary to the safety plan and should not be considered a replacement for professional help.
