**First Aid Guide: Self-Harm**

**1. Definition and Symptoms:**

*   **Definition:** Self-harm is the intentional act of inflicting harm upon one's own body. It is typically a coping mechanism for intense emotional pain, distress, or overwhelming feelings. It is not usually a suicide attempt, although it can increase the risk of suicide.

*   **Common Forms of Self-Harm:**
    *   Cutting: Using sharp objects (razors, knives, glass) to make cuts on the skin.
    *   Burning: Using heat sources (lighters, cigarettes, hot objects) to burn the skin.
    *   Scratching: Using fingernails or other objects to scratch the skin, drawing blood.
    *   Hitting/Punching: Hitting oneself or objects.
    *   Head Banging: Repeatedly hitting one's head against a hard surface.
    *   Picking/Pulling Skin or Hair: Compulsively picking at skin, scabs, or pulling out hair.
    *   Poisoning/Overdosing (Non-Lethal): Taking substances in amounts not intended to cause death but to inflict harm.
    *   Interfering with wound healing.
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Unexplained cuts, burns, bruises, or other wounds, often in patterns.
    *   Frequent use of bandages or clothing to cover up wounds, even in warm weather.
    *   Possession of sharp objects (razors, knives, etc.) without a clear purpose.
    *   Social isolation or withdrawal from friends and family.
    *   Difficulty managing emotions, impulsivity, and/or mood swings.
    *   Statements of hopelessness, worthlessness, or intense emotional pain.
    *   Evidence of substance abuse.
    *   Changes in eating or sleeping habits.
    *   Preoccupation with self-harm thoughts or behaviors.
    *   Finding blood stains on clothes or items.

**2. When to Seek Emergency Medical Help:**

*   **Signs of a Life-Threatening Situation:**
    *   **Deep Wounds:** Deep cuts that expose muscle or bone, or that bleed profusely and do not stop with direct pressure.
    *   **Severe Burns:** Burns that cover a large area of the body, are deep, or involve the face, hands, feet, or genitals.
    *   **Significant Blood Loss:** Uncontrolled bleeding that causes dizziness, weakness, or loss of consciousness.
    *   **Overdose:** Ingestion of a potentially lethal substance or amount of a substance. Symptoms may include difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness, seizures, or irregular heartbeat.
*   **If any of the above signs are present:**
    *   **Call Emergency Services (911 in the US):** Immediately call for emergency medical assistance.
    *   **Do not attempt to transport the person yourself** unless instructed to do so by emergency services.
