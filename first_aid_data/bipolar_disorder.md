**First Aid Guide: Bipolar Disorder**

**1. Definition and Symptoms**

*   **Definition:** Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental health condition characterized by extreme shifts in mood, energy, thinking, and behavior. These shifts range from periods of intensely high, elated, irritable, or energized moods (manic or hypomanic episodes) to periods of profound sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest (depressive episodes).
*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Manic Episode:**
        *   Elevated, expansive, or irritable mood
        *   Increased energy and activity levels
        *   Racing thoughts
        *   Rapid speech
        *   Decreased need for sleep
        *   Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity
        *   Impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors (e.g., excessive spending, reckless driving, risky sexual encounters)
        *   Distractibility
        *   Increased goal-directed activity
    *   **Hypomanic Episode:** Similar to manic episodes but less severe and shorter in duration. Hypomanic episodes do not typically cause significant impairment in social or occupational functioning and do not involve psychotic features.
    *   **Depressive Episode:**
        *   Persistent sadness, hopelessness, or emptiness
        *   Loss of interest or pleasure in activities
        *   Changes in appetite or weight
        *   Sleep disturbances (insomnia or excessive sleep)
        *   Fatigue or loss of energy
        *   Feelings of worthlessness or guilt
        *   Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
        *   Restlessness or slowed movements
        *   Thoughts of death or suicide

**2. When to Seek Emergency Medical Help**

*   **Suicidal Ideation or Attempts:** Any expression of suicidal thoughts, plans, or attempts requires immediate intervention. Call emergency services (911 in the US), a suicide hotline, or take the person to the nearest emergency room.
*   **Psychotic Symptoms:** Hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized thinking that impair the person's ability to function or pose a risk to themselves or others.
*   **Severe Mania or Depression:** Episodes of mania or depression that are so severe they significantly impair the person's ability to function, pose a risk to their safety, or require hospitalization.
*   **Aggressive or Violent Behavior:** Behavior that poses a threat to the person's safety or the safety of others.
*   **Medical Emergency Related to Bipolar Disorder:** For example, if someone is experiencing a medical complication due to medication side effects.

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures**

*   **Prioritize Safety:** Ensure the safety of the person and those around them. Remove any potential hazards from the immediate area.

*   **Reduce Stimulation:** Minimize environmental stimuli such as loud noises, bright lights, and excessive social interaction.
*   **Offer Reality Orientation:** If the person is experiencing confusion or disorientation, gently orient them to reality (e.g., reminding them of the date, time, and place).
*   **De-escalation Techniques:** If the person is agitated or aggressive, use de-escalation techniques such as:
    *   Maintaining a safe distance.
    *   Speaking calmly and slowly.
    *   Avoiding direct eye contact.
    *   Acknowledging their feelings.
    *   Offering choices and compromises when possible.
