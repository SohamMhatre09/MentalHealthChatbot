        *   Digestive problems (e.g., upset stomach, diarrhea, constipation)
        *   Rapid heartbeat, increased blood pressure
        *   Weakened immune system (increased susceptibility to illness)
    *   **Emotional Symptoms:**
        *   Irritability, mood swings
        *   Anxiety, worry, feeling overwhelmed

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures:**

        5.  Repeat for 5-10 minutes, focusing on slow, deep breaths.

        4.  Exhale slowly through the mouth for a count of 4.
        5.  Hold the breath for a count of 4.
        6.  Repeat for 5-10 minutes.

        2.  Instruct them to concentrate on the details of the sensation, directing their attention away from anxious thoughts.

*   **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR):**
    *   1.  Have the individual sit or lie down comfortably.
        2.  Starting with the feet, tense the muscles in that area as tightly as possible for 5-10 seconds.
        3.  Slowly release the tension, focusing on the feeling of relaxation.
        4.  Repeat this process for each muscle group, working your way up the body (calves, thighs, buttocks, abdomen, chest, hands, arms, shoulders, neck, face).

*   **Guided Imagery:**
    *   Instruct the individual to close their eyes and imagine a peaceful scene (e.g., a beach, a forest, a mountain).
    *   Guide them through the scene, encouraging them to engage their senses (e.g., imagine the sounds of the waves, the smell of the pine trees, the warmth of the sun).
    *   Focus on the positive and relaxing aspects of the scene.

    *   If the individual is willing, allow them to talk about what is causing them stress.
    *   Listen attentively without judgment.
    *   Offer support and empathy.
    *   Avoid giving unsolicited advice or trying to fix the problem.
