**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures**

**Prioritize Safety:** Ensure the safety of the individual and the baby.  If there is a risk of harm to self or others, do not hesitate to call emergency services.

**A. Approach and Assess:**

1.  **Approach Calmly:** Maintain a calm and reassuring demeanor.
2.  **Assess the Situation:** Determine the immediate needs and level of distress. Is the person actively suicidal or psychotic?
3.  **Ensure Safety:** If there is any immediate danger to the person or the baby, remove them from the situation and call for help.

**B. Active Listening and Support:**

1.  **Listen Empathetically:** Offer a non-judgmental listening ear.  Avoid interrupting or offering unsolicited advice.
2.  **Validate Feelings:** Acknowledge and validate the person's emotions. Statements like "That sounds really difficult" or "It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed" can be helpful.
3.  **Reassure:** Reassure the person that they are not alone, and that help is available.
4.  **Avoid Minimizing:**  Avoid statements like "It's just baby blues" or "Things will get better." These can be dismissive and invalidating.

1.  **Identify Needs:**  Gently ask what would be helpful in that moment.  This might include help with childcare, household chores, or getting to a safe place.
2.  **Offer Practical Support:** If possible, offer concrete assistance with childcare, meals, or errands.
3.  **Help Connect with Resources:** Provide information about local mental health resources, such as therapists, support groups, and crisis hotlines.  Help the person contact these resources if they are willing.

**D. Post-Crisis:**

1.  **Follow Up:** Check in with the person regularly to see how they are doing.
2.  **Encourage Professional Help:**  Continue to encourage the person to seek professional help.
