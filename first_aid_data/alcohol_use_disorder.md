**First Aid Guide: Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)**

**1. Definition and Symptoms**

*   **Definition:** Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive alcohol seeking and use, despite negative consequences. It encompasses both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence (alcoholism). AUD is diagnosed based on specific criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   **Behavioral:**
        *   Drinking more or longer than intended.
        *   Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use.
        *   Spending a great deal of time obtaining, using, or recovering from alcohol use.
        *   Craving or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol.
        *   Continued alcohol use despite recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol.
        *   Giving up or reducing important social, occupational, or recreational activities because of alcohol use.
        *   Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.
        *   Continued alcohol use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by alcohol.
    *   **Physical:**
        *   **Tolerance:** A need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect, or a markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol.
        *   **Withdrawal:** The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol, manifested by symptoms such as:
            *   Sweating
            *   Tremor
            *   Anxiety
            *   Agitation
            *   Nausea and vomiting
            *   Seizures
            *   Hallucinations (visual, tactile, or auditory)
            *   Insomnia
        *   Alcohol is often taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

    *Severity of AUD is categorized based on the number of criteria met:
        * Mild: 2-3 criteria
        * Moderate: 4-5 criteria
        * Severe: 6 or more criteria

**2. When to Seek Emergency Medical Help**

    *   Blue-tinged or pale skin
    *   Hypothermia (low body temperature)
    *   Unconsciousness or inability to be roused

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures**

*   **For Alcohol Poisoning:**
    1.  **Call Emergency Services Immediately:**  Do not hesitate to call for help.
    2.  **Stay with the Person:** Monitor their breathing, level of consciousness, and vital signs.
    3.  **Keep Them Awake:** Try to keep the person awake and sitting up if possible. If unconscious, place them in the recovery position (see below).
    4.  **Recovery Position (for unconscious individuals):**
        *   Kneel beside the person.
        *   Extend the arm nearest you above their head.
        *   Gently pull the far arm across their chest.
        *   Bend the far leg at the knee.
        *   Pull on the bent leg to roll the person towards you onto their side.
        *   Ensure the airway is open by tilting the head back and lifting the chin.
        *   Monitor breathing continuously.
    5.  **Prevent Choking:** If the person vomits, clear their airway immediately by turning them onto their side.
    6.  **Cover with a Blanket:** To prevent hypothermia.
    7.  **Do NOT:**

*   **For Alcohol Withdrawal (Mild to Moderate - *If severe, see emergency situations*):**
    1.  **Ensure Safety:** Create a calm and safe environment.
    2.  **Monitor Vital Signs:** Check heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature regularly.
    3.  **Provide Hydration:** Offer water, juice, or electrolyte solutions to combat dehydration.
    4.  **Provide Nutrition:** Offer easily digestible foods if the person can tolerate them (e.g., crackers, soup).
    5.  **Calm Reassurance:** Provide reassurance and support. Avoid confrontation.
    6.  **Medication (if prescribed):** If the person has been prescribed medications (e.g., benzodiazepines) for alcohol withdrawal, ensure they take them as directed by a healthcare professional.
    7.  **Seek Medical Evaluation:** Encourage the person to seek medical evaluation to manage withdrawal symptoms and address underlying AUD.

*   **Early Intervention:** Identify individuals at risk for developing AUD and provide early intervention services.

*   **Limit Access:** Limit access to alcohol, especially for underage individuals.
*   **Support Treatment and Recovery:** Support individuals seeking treatment for AUD and provide resources for long-term recovery.
*   **Policy Changes:** Advocate for policies that reduce alcohol-related harm, such as increasing alcohol taxes, restricting alcohol advertising, and strengthening drunk driving laws.
*   **Mental Health Awareness:** Promote mental health awareness and access to mental health services, as AUD often co-occurs with mental health disorders.
*   **Screening:** Encourage routine screening for alcohol use during healthcare visits.
