**First Aid Guide: Psychotic Break**

**1. Definition and Symptoms**

*   **Definition:** A psychotic break (more accurately described as an acute psychotic episode) is a period of psychosis where a person loses touch with reality. It is characterized by a disruption in a person's thoughts, perceptions, and behaviors. It can be a manifestation of an underlying mental health condition like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe depression, substance use, or other medical conditions.

*   **Common Symptoms:**
    *   **Hallucinations:** Experiencing sensory perceptions that are not real, such as hearing voices, seeing things, smelling odors, feeling sensations on the skin, or tasting things that are not there.
    *   **Delusions:** Holding firmly to false beliefs that are not based in reality and cannot be changed by evidence. Common examples include:
        *   **Persecutory Delusions:** Belief that one is being harmed, harassed, or conspired against.
        *   **Grandiose Delusions:** Belief that one has exceptional abilities, wealth, or fame.
        *   **Referential Delusions:** Belief that certain gestures, comments, passages from books, or song lyrics are directed at oneself.

        *   **Avolition:** Lack of motivation.
        *   **Anhedonia:** Inability to experience pleasure.

    *   **Unresponsive:** If the person is not responding to stimuli or is losing consciousness.
    *   **Acute Medical Condition:** If the psychotic symptoms are sudden in onset, especially in the absence of a prior history of psychosis, consider a possible medical cause.

*   **Non-Emergency but Urgent Care:** If the person is not an immediate danger but is showing severe psychotic symptoms, take them to the nearest emergency room or urgent care facility.
