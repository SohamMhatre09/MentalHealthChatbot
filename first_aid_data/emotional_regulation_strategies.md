**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures:**

These procedures are intended to provide immediate support during an episode of emotional dysregulation:

1.  **Ensure Safety:**

2.  **Approach Calmly and Empathetically:**
    *   Speak in a calm, reassuring tone.
    *   Maintain a safe and non-threatening distance.
    *   Acknowledge the individual's feelings without judgment. (e.g., "I can see that you're feeling very upset right now.")

3.  **Active Listening:**
    *   Listen attentively to what the individual is saying without interrupting (unless necessary to ensure safety).
    *   Use open-ended questions to encourage them to express their feelings. (e.g., "Can you tell me more about what's happening?")
    *   Reflect back what you hear to ensure understanding. (e.g., "So, it sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by...")

4.  **Grounding Techniques (If Appropriate):**
    *   If the individual is experiencing intense anxiety or panic, guide them through grounding techniques to bring them back to the present moment. Examples include:

5.  **Validation and Reassurance:**
    *   Validate the individual's feelings, even if you don't understand them. (e.g., "It's okay to feel angry/sad/anxious.")
    *   Reassure them that they are not alone and that you are there to support them.
    *   Remind them that these feelings are temporary and will eventually pass.

6.  **Distraction (If Appropriate):**

        *   Watching a lighthearted movie or TV show
        *   Engaging in a simple activity (e.g., coloring, drawing)

7.  **Problem-Solving (If Appropriate):**
    *   Once the individual has calmed down, gently explore potential solutions to the underlying problems that are contributing to their emotional distress.
    *   Encourage them to identify small, manageable steps that they can take to address the situation.
    *   Avoid giving unsolicited advice or trying to fix the problem for them.

8.  **Follow-Up:**
