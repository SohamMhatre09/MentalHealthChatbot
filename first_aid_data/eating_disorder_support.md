This first aid guide provides information and support for individuals experiencing or supporting someone with an eating disorder. It is NOT a substitute for professional medical or psychological evaluation and treatment. Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses with potentially life-threatening consequences.

**1. Definition and Symptoms of Eating Disorders**

Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses characterized by persistent disturbances of eating or eating-related behavior that result in altered consumption or absorption of food and that significantly impair physical health or psychosocial functioning.  They are not simply "lifestyle choices" but complex conditions with biological, psychological, and social contributing factors.

**Common Types of Eating Disorders:**

*   **Anorexia Nervosa (AN):** Characterized by persistent restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health. Individuals with AN have an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though underweight, and a disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight.
    *   **Symptoms:**
        *   Significantly low body weight
        *   Intense fear of gaining weight
        *   Distorted body image
        *   Restricting food intake
        *   Excessive exercise
        *   Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation in females)
        *   Lanugo (fine, downy hair on the body)
        *   Constipation
        *   Cold intolerance
        *   Fatigue
        *   Dizziness or fainting

*   **Bulimia Nervosa (BN):** Characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications, fasting, or excessive exercise.
    *   **Symptoms:**
        *   Recurrent episodes of binge eating (eating an unusually large amount of food in a discrete period of time with a sense of lack of control)
        *   Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors
        *   Self-evaluation unduly influenced by body shape and weight
        *   Normal or slightly overweight
        *   Dental problems (erosion of enamel from vomiting)
        *   Swollen salivary glands
        *   Esophageal damage
        *   Electrolyte imbalances
        *   Irregular bowel movements
        *   Dehydration

*   **Binge-Eating Disorder (BED):** Characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating without regular inappropriate compensatory behaviors.
    *   **Symptoms:**
        *   Recurrent episodes of binge eating (eating an unusually large amount of food in a discrete period of time with a sense of lack of control)
        *   Eating more rapidly than normal
        *   Eating until feeling uncomfortably full
        *   Eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry
        *   Eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating
        *   Feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterward
        *   Marked distress regarding binge eating

*   **Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED):** This category includes eating disorders that cause significant distress or impairment but do not meet the full criteria for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge-eating disorder.  Examples include atypical anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa of low frequency, binge-eating disorder of low frequency, purging disorder, and night eating syndrome.

*   **Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID):** Characterized by a lack of interest in eating or food; avoidance based on the sensory characteristics of food; or concern about aversive consequences of eating, leading to significant weight loss (or failure to achieve expected weight gain or faltering growth in children); significant nutritional deficiency; dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements; or marked interference with psychosocial functioning. ARFID does NOT involve distress about body shape or weight.

**2. When to Seek Emergency Medical Help**

**Immediate medical attention is crucial if any of the following are present:**

*   **Severe dehydration:** Signs include extreme thirst, dry mouth and skin, decreased urination, dizziness, or lightheadedness.
*   **Electrolyte imbalances:** Signs include muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat, seizures, or confusion.
*   **Chest pain or palpitations:** Could indicate heart problems due to malnutrition or electrolyte imbalance.
*   **Severe bradycardia (slow heart rate):**  Heart rate below 40 beats per minute.
*   **Hypotension (low blood pressure):**  Systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg.
*   **Hypothermia (low body temperature):** Body temperature below 95°F (35°C).
*   **Severe abdominal pain:**  Could indicate gastrointestinal complications.
*   **Hematemesis (vomiting blood):** Indicates potential damage to the esophagus or stomach.
*   **Melena (black, tarry stools):** Indicates bleeding in the digestive tract.
*   **Syncope (fainting) or loss of consciousness:**
*   **Seizures:**
*   **Suicidal ideation or intent:** If the individual expresses thoughts of harming themselves.  This should be taken extremely seriously.
*   **Severe self-harm:** Cutting, burning, or other forms of self-injury.
*   **Uncontrollable purging:**  Frequent and persistent vomiting or laxative abuse leading to significant physical distress.
*   **Rapid weight loss:**  Losing a significant amount of weight in a short period (e.g., >10% of body weight in 3-6 months).
*   **Unstable vital signs:** Erratic pulse, blood pressure, or respiratory rate.
*   **Inability to keep down food or fluids:**  Leading to rapid dehydration.

**Actions to take in an emergency:**

*   **Call emergency services (911 in the US, 999 in the UK, 000 in Australia, or your local emergency number).**
*   **Stay with the person until help arrives.**  Provide reassurance and monitor their condition.
*   **Provide information to the emergency responders:**  Explain the situation, any known medical history, and medications they are taking.
*   **If the person is unconscious, ensure their airway is open and monitor their breathing. Perform CPR if necessary (if you are trained).**

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures**

**Important Note:** These are general first aid guidelines.  Individualized care plans developed by a medical professional should be followed if available.

*   **Step 1:  Assessment and Safety:**
    *   **Ensure Safety:**  Remove any immediate dangers, such as access to harmful substances (e.g., laxatives, emetics) or objects that could be used for self-harm.
    *   **Assess Consciousness:**  Check if the person is responsive.  If not, follow emergency procedures.
    *   **Check Vital Signs (if possible):**  Note pulse, breathing rate, and level of consciousness.  However, prioritizing immediate medical help is crucial in critical situations.
    *   **Acknowledge and Validate:**  Acknowledge the person's feelings and validate their experiences.  Avoid judgment or criticism.

*   **Step 2: Addressing Immediate Physical Concerns (If Applicable):**
    *   **Dehydration:** If conscious and able to swallow, offer small sips of water or electrolyte-containing beverages.  Avoid forcing fluids.
    *   **Dizziness/Lightheadedness:** Help the person sit or lie down to prevent fainting. Elevate their legs slightly.
    *   **Hypothermia:** Cover the person with blankets to warm them up.  Seek medical attention for severe hypothermia.
    *   **Abdominal Pain:**  Encourage the person to rest.  Avoid giving them food or medications unless directed by a medical professional.
    *   **Vomiting:** Provide a container and assist the person. Ensure they are sitting upright to prevent aspiration. Rinse their mouth with water afterward.
    *   **Self-Harm:** If the person has self-inflicted injuries, provide basic first aid (e.g., clean and bandage cuts).  Seek immediate medical attention for serious injuries.

*   **Step 3:  Providing Emotional Support:**
    *   **Listen Actively:**  Provide a safe and non-judgmental space for the person to express their feelings.
    *   **Offer Reassurance:** Let the person know that you care and that help is available.
    *   **Avoid Giving Advice:** Focus on listening and validating their feelings rather than trying to solve their problems. Avoid making comments about their weight or appearance.
    *   **Encourage Professional Help:** Gently suggest seeking professional help from a therapist, psychiatrist, or eating disorder specialist.
    *   **Stay Calm:** Your calmness can help de-escalate the situation.
    *   **Avoid Confrontation:** Do not argue with them about their eating disorder behaviors. This can be counterproductive.

*   **Step 4:  Following Up:**
    *   **Connect with Resources:** Help the person connect with eating disorder support organizations, hotlines, or online resources (listed below).
    *   **Respect Boundaries:** Be mindful of the person's boundaries and respect their decisions about seeking help.
    *   **Practice Self-Care:** Supporting someone with an eating disorder can be emotionally draining.  Ensure you are taking care of your own well-being.
    *   **Maintain Communication:** If appropriate, maintain contact with the person to offer ongoing support.

**4. Home Remedies and Self-Care Tips**
