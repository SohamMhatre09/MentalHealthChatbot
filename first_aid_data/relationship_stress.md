**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures:**

**A. Assess the Situation:**

1.  **Recognize the signs:**  Identify the symptoms of relationship stress you are experiencing (as outlined above).
2.  **Identify the stressors:** Pinpoint the specific factors contributing to the stress (e.g., communication problems, financial issues).
3.  **Assess the severity:** Determine the intensity of the stress and its impact on your daily life.
4.  **Ensure safety:** If abuse is involved, prioritize safety and seek immediate help.

**B. Provide Immediate Relief:**

1.  **Create distance (Temporary Separation):**  If the situation is volatile, create physical distance to de-escalate the situation. This can involve taking a break to calm down. Communicate your need for space respectfully.
2.  **Practice Relaxation Techniques:**  Engage in deep breathing exercises, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation to reduce anxiety and promote calmness.
3.  **Express Your Feelings (Controlled Environment):**  When calm, express your feelings and needs to your partner (if safe and appropriate) in a non-confrontational manner. Use "I" statements (e.g., "I feel hurt when...") instead of accusatory "you" statements.
4.  **Focus on basic needs:** Ensure you are eating regularly, sleeping adequately, and staying hydrated. Neglecting these basic needs can exacerbate stress.
